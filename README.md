# Roar
Roar is a straightforward microblogging platform built on MeteorJS + Bootstrap. Why build a Twitter clone in 2015? The microblogging software I encountered online was either outdated or frustrating to set up. With Meteor, Roar can be up and running in under 5 minutes. While simple, it has many of the same features that made Twitter so successful, such as hashtags and tagging other users.

#Set Up
  1. Download Meteor ```$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh ```
  2. Clone the repo ```$ git clone https://github.com/robertramsey/roar.git ```
  3. Change to the Roar directory ```$ cd roar ```
  4. Run Meteor. It will take a couple of minutes to download the packages ```$ meteor ```
  5. Navigate on over to ```localhost:3000 ```You now have your own instance of Roar going!

#Status
Roar is currently in Alpha at the moment. There are some bugs that still need ironing out, and it's not quite mobile friendly yet.
